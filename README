- This is an offline two player game
- Each player is a flower
- You move them with [WASD] or [←↑↓→]
- [WASD]’s attraction move is triggered by [space]
- [←↑↓→]’s attraction move is triggered by [↩]
- The goal is to catch the other flower's pollen
- Flowers can’t “touch” each other
- After 10 “touches”, it is game over
- Remaining “touches” are illustrated by the purple bars
- The flower who harvest the most pollen win

The game could be describe as an anti-shooter where instead of avoiding 'bullets', you try to collect them. It's fast pace, it feel like a dogfight. It feature a minimalistic look, where flowers are represented by simple circles.  The score screen is also minimalistic, as it only show the flowers respective size, the biggest is the winner.  
  
There is no timer, the game end after flowers collide into each other 10 times.  

The game was code in coffeescript using the html canvas element.  
  
Test in Mac OSX Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers.  Should run find in IE 10 (should). 

If the game is sluggish in fullscreen try to run it in smaller window (Dont't forget to reload the page after resize).  The bigger the canvas element is, the longer it take to render each frame.  If you can, go fullscreen for a greater experience.

TOjam was a real fun experience for me, tks Jim!
